title: Wildfly 8
---

This is a basic introduction to the Wildfly 8 features.

- High Performance Web Server (Undertow.io)
- Port Reduction
- Management Role Based Access Control (RBAC) & Auditing
- Security Manager
- Logging
- Clustering
- JDK8 Compatibility
- Highlights

## Undertow

- [Undertow.io](http://undertow.io/)
- New core **web server** & **servlet container** - Can be used without any servlets as well
- **Non-blocking** and **blocking** handlers
- Traditional and asynchronous servlets
- **Lightweight**: core jar coming in at under 1Mb
- **Web Socket** Support
- Supports **Servlet 3.1**
- **Embeddable**: Can be embedded in an application or run standalone easily
- [Many others](http://undertow.io/documentation/index.html)

## Port reduction

- All the protocols multiplexed over two HTTP ports: Management port and an Application port

## Management Role Based Access Control (RBAC) & Auditing

- Different sets of permissions control
- Audit changes
- Manage users
- LDAP integration to support groups and roles

## Security Manager

- Per-deployment security permissions
- Performance improvement
- In addition to the standard Java EE ```permissions.xml```, a more flexible ```jboss-permissions.xml``` descriptor is also supported.

## Logging

- The management API supports list and view log files on a server.
- Possible to define custom formatters, apart from the default pattern formatter.
- ```add-logging-api-dependencies``` attribute to enable / disable implicit server logging.
- ```use-deployment-logging-config``` attribute enable / disable logging configuration files found on deployment.

## Clustering

- Support hugely refactored on Wildfly 8
- Optimized **distributed web session** for use with undertow
- Optimized **single sign-on (SSO)** support for undertow
- Optimized stateful @EJB caching implementation
- Public **clustering API**: Applications can *view cluster topology*, listen for its *changes*, broadcast/submit commands to a cluster (**remote execution**)

## Core distribution

- Wildfly 8 architecture distribution. Ideal for framework authors

## JDK8 compatibility

- Full support to JDK8.
- Migration to the JDK8 is encouraged, and its new features may be used soon.

## Web Services

- @PolicySets: Policy assertions in predefined groups and scenarios.
- WS-Discovery support: Allows selected deployments to be automatically registered with the **discovery service**, so outside consumers can discover available endpoints.
- REST: includes RESTEasy 3 - supports the standard Java EE REST APIs (JAX-RS 2.0)

## Highlights

- Optimized **boot process**
- Agressive **memory management** in order to minimize max heap memory allocation (= Less GC). Allow WildFly to run on devices with limited physical resources
- No more <s>**Hierarchical classloading**</s> : Wildfly modular structure only links JAR files to the application when it needs it.
- Centralized **settings**
- **Standalone** and **Domain** (+servers) modes
- Deployment API
- **Distributed caching** (using [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org/), a [standalone project](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Infinispan+Subsystem))
- **Distributed deployment** on [managed domain](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Application+deployment)
- **Clustering API** looks very promising. [Samples](http://www.mastertheboss.com/jboss-server/jboss-cluster/monitoring-a-cluster-using-wildfly-api)
