title: Architectural styles
---

Given the importance, and the growing need of dealing with **quality** and **maintainability** targets, through software architecture techniques (as exposed on the [previous post]({% post_url 2014-11-03-architecture-oriented-development %})), there are categorizations of architectural styles which supports the required characteristics of software systems. 

The **architectural styles** use clear **terminologies**, **properties** and **restrictions** to identify the components (a.k.a subsystems) and interaction mechanisms between them, what is specially usefull for software engineers to **reuse** the architectural patterns on scenarios in which they are needed. 

Each **style** supports a set of **non-functional requirements** and **project attributes** what makes possible distinguish between different architectures.

## #1 Pipes and filters

Characteristics:

- Data flow which goes from an edge (**origin**) to another (**destination**)
- Data is processed and transformed on **filters**
- **Unidirectional** flow = Operations chaining

An example of pipes and filters would be the following UNIX command:

{% highlight bash %}
sample$ who | sort
{% endhighlight %}

The result of *who* is a list of currently connected users, and its output is used as the input of *sort*, which orders the values alphabetically.

![Unix who | sort](/assets/arch-styles-pipe-and-filter.png)

The two programs, *who* and *sort* are **components** called **filters**. Notice that the filters can start putting the transformation outcome on the pipes *before all the input data is processed*, and that the sort output could lead to another filter represented on the picture by the dotted box.

Another example of pipes & filters architectural style can be found at the classical *compilers* model. The first compilers used to work in two steps: *source language analysis* and *code synthesis* (Aho, 1987). With the hardware evolution, the need of **portability** started raising, and the classical model needed to be enhanced to a new process, composed by 3-legged analysis (lexical, syntactic & semantic analysis), and 2-step synthesis (optimization & generation).

It is worth to comment that this architectural style is normally **flexible**, enabling the pipes and filters reorganization. Although this style provides *maintainability* support in terms of easy reorganization, it is clear that frequent changes on a component (filter) can impact the other components, so maintainability support is limited on this style.

<br />
## #2 Layers

The **layered** architectural style structures a system into a set of layers, where each of them groups a set of *tasks* in a certain level of *abstraction*. 

In a layered architecture, a layer on the N level normally offers a set of functionalities to the above level (N + 1). N uses its functions as well as it uses the functionality provided by the below layer (n - 1). 

A variation of this style could enable the N layer to access N-2, N-3 and so on, but notice that doing so the system **maintainability can be affected**. Having a bigger dependency level between layers imply on more layers to be changed once having a new requirement or change. 

A good example of this style is the **OSI** (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model (Tanenbaum, 1988). On this model each *layer* can be seen as a *component* which can be implemented by software or hardware. It is composed by 7 layers and serves as the computer network protocol architecture.

- 7. Application
- 6. Presentation
- 5. Session
- 4. Transport
- 3. Network
- 2. Data link
- 1. Physical

In fact a layered architecture gives a higher level of *flexibility*, however this has an associate **cost** on the system **performance**, as an external request needs to pass through many layers in order to be handled. Anyway, implementing a **monolithic** system / protocol isn't an appropriate solution as well.

<br />
## #3 Objects

The object oriented paradigm adds another sort of abstraction to software designers. The fundamental idea behind this approach is *combining* in a single entity **both data and functions which operates on this data**. This entity is nominated **object**.
