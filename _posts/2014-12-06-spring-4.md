title: Spring 4
---

> The Spring Framework was first released in 2004; since then there have been significant major revisions: Spring 2.0 provided XML namespaces and AspectJ support; Spring 2.5 embraced annotation-driven configuration; Spring 3.0 introduced a strong Java 5+ foundation across the framework codebase, and features such as the Java-based @Configuration model.

> Version 4.0 is the latest major release of the Spring Framework and the first to fully support Java 8 features. You can still use Spring with older versions of Java, however, the minimum requirement has now been raised to Java SE 6. We have also taken the opportunity of a major release to remove many deprecated classes and methods.

## Removed deprecated stuff

[Details](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.4.RELEASE_to_4.0.0.RELEASE/)

## Java 8 support
- Support for **lambda expressions** & **method references** with Spring callback interfaces.
- First class support to **java.time**
- Compatibility with Java 6 & 7 maintained.

## Groovy Bean Definition DSL

- Bean configuration using Groovy DSL

Sample:

	def reader = new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(myApplicationContext)
	reader.beans {
	    dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
	        driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
	        url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"
	        username = "sa"
	        password = ""
	        settings = [mynew:"setting"]
	    }
	    sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
	        dataSource = dataSource
	    }
	    myService(MyService) {
	        nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->
	            dataSource = dataSource
	        }
	    }
	}
