title: Requirement patterns - Introduction
---

## Definition

- **Traditional approach**: Up-to-front. Requirements specified before moving to development.
- **Extreme approach**: software production as rapidly as possible.
- **Incremental approach**: Partially up-to-front, partially later on.
- *"What a software system is for and what it must do"*. **What** the system needs to do, but not **how**.
- The **problem** that has to be solved. Does not define a **solution**.
- A single, **measurable objective** that a system must satisfy.
- Specification = Requirement documents
- Levels = Structure = Epics / Stories / etc.
- Functional vs Non-Functional

## Requirements position on the big picture

- **Stages** of development
- Sample stages (not necessarily isolating one od each other): Scope > **Requirements** > Design > Development > Testing > Deployment
- **Iterative** processes

## Principles

1. Specify the **problem**, not the **solution**.
2. Specify the **system** not the **project**. Write every specification to be **timeless**.
3. Specify the **formal and informal** parts. Requirements as a **contract** of what must be delivered. The readers need *background*, *context*, *flow* and *structure*.
4. Avoid **repeatition** = Less inconsistencies and Extra work
