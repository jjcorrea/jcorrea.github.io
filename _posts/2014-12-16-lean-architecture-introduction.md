title: Lean architecture - Introduction

## Touchstones: Lean & Agile

- Buzzwords ahead.
- 90s management culture = Toyota way / Lean term coined
- **Value stream** = primary focus = "Every single activity adds value"
- Waste *reduces* value. Constant improvement *increases* value
- "All hands on deck" mentality = **Team**
- Agile manifesto enphasizes the **customer**, Lean = **stakeholders** (everybody in sight)
- Not about working: harder, "smarter", but more about **focus** and **discipline**.
- The architecture should support the company value stream
- *Just in time deliver* instead of *stockpilling* software library warehouses = **Continuous flow**
