The Simian Army is a suite of tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form. Chaos Monkey, the first member, is a resiliency tool that helps ensure that your applications can tolerate random instance failures.

Consists of services (Monkeys) in the cloud for generating various kinds of failures, detecting abnormal conditions, and testing our ability to survive them. The goal is to **keep our cloud safe, secure, and highly available**.
